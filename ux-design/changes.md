Hello this is Victoria Poliakova submitting Homework for UX Designer role.

My UX experience is vast.  For the Case Study I've attached in the overview deck, I was tasked with a complete redesign of a Patient Portal for WRS Health, a Software-As-A-Service company. 

In all digital initiatives I focus on the user first and formost.  Key targets have been identified and interviewed as part of the process.  In a well designed Patient Portal, benefits are two-fold:  medical practice shortens the time for administrative tasks and allows more time spent with patients when most of the crucial information is filled out ahead of time.  Patients benefit by having direct access to their medical records, health information, test results, etc.

Key objectives for the redesign included easy, intuitive navigational experience, responsiveness -- large number of users would access the portal on their mobile devices, and relevancy of most important information. 

A number of layout and content parsing approaches were considered, final design allowing for expand-collapse functionality, section color coding, and limited number of funtions per screen so not to overwhelm and slow the user.

Technical implementation stages are underway currently.

Thank you and feel free with any additional questions.
